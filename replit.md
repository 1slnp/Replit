## Data Flow

### Cover Art Generation Flow
1. User submits form with artist name, album title, genre, and AI prompt
2. System validates required fields and token availability
3. Token is deducted and generation request is processed
4. Result is stored in database with image path
5. Generated cover art is displayed to user

### Vocal Mastering Flow
1. User uploads audio file and selects mastering template
2. File is validated for format and size (100MB limit)
3. Job is created with "processing" status
4. EQ settings and template are stored as JSON
5. Processing status is updated upon completion
6. Mastered file is made available for download

### Session Management
